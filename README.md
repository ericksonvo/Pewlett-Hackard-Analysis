The image above shows the employees that are qualifed for the Mentorship Program, it shows that a total of 1549 are qualified for the Mentorship Program. However, comparing it to the number of employees leaving it isnt nearly enough to fill the spaces for employee when retirement comes. Another thing to note is that the Senior Staff has 569 and Senior Engineer has 529 employees ready for the program. This may not be a remarkable number compared to retiring employees however, it will be a great small step for PH to fill the empty spots. 

## Summary
In summary as the data provides it shows that a total of 72458 employees are ready for retiring. As the silver tsunami begins PH would need to fill many staff in Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Regular Staff, Technique Leader, Assistand Engineer and Manager. First, Focusing on filling atleast 80% for each title would be sufficent. However, the main focus for hiring new employees should be in Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.

As for the Mentorship Program it shows that only a total of 1549 employees are qualified to fill the spots for retiring employees. This is not nearly enough to fill the empty spots whent the silver tsunami hits. But given the data it gives PH a great start on where to begin, for looking for new employees.
